# Sorting

1. [Quadratic](./Sorting/1.Quadratic) (Selection, Bubble, Insertion)
2. [Logarithmic](./Sorting/2.Logarithmic) (Merge, Quick, Heap)
3. [Logarithmic](./Sorting/3.Linear) (Counting Sort)

# Graphs

1. [How To Represent a Graph](./Graphs/GraphInMemory.cs)
2. [Traverse](./Graphs/Traverse) (BFS and DFS)
3. [Shortest Path](./Graphs/ShortestPath) (Dijstra with array and queue)
4. [Minimal Spanning Tree](./Graphs/MinimalSpanningTree) (Kruskal, Prim)
5. [Topological Sort](./Graphs/TopologicalSort.cs)

# Dynamic Programming

1. [Sub-array with maximum sum](./DynamicProgramming/MaxSubArraySum.cs)
2. [Sub-array with maximum sum (divide and conquer)](./DynamicProgramming/MaxSubArraySum_DivideAndConquer.cs). NOTE: this is much worse than the dynamic programming solution, but returns begining and end indices of the max sum array!
